# Podcast Hub
Podcast Hub is a web application built on MERN. 

## Aim

Build a robust podcast application using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. 

This project is intended to help further develop my JavaScript and MERN skills. Main areas of focus will be on using React, implementing authorization (Passport.js) and learning MongoDB/Mongoose patterns, as opposed to traditional database relationships. 

## Features
- Multi user authentication and authorization using Passport.js
- Allow users to add their favourite podcasts using an RSS link or by browing through an API.
- Mark podcasts as favourites, others for later listening, take notes, timestamps.
- Use an embedded media player to listen to podcasts.
- Set up custom alerts when new podcasts are released. 

## Learning Outcomes
- Further React experience
- Implement various MongoDB schemas and references 
- Learn authorization using Passport.js, experiment with JWT vs. cookies, etc.
- Learn how to cache data, look at different methods of cacheing or validating existing data.
- Solidify Node, Express skills.
